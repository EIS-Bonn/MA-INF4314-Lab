### Welcome to the ChartAdvisor wiki!

## ChartAdvisor: Efficient Algorithm for Recommendation of Data Visualization Tools.
Chart Advisor is a standalone software that processes an Input RDF Dataset and produces as result a ranked list of recommended visualization tools (charts) such as Pie, Column, Line charts (and [others](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/wiki/Technical-Documentation#3-data-structure)). The core algorithm of the software is intended to be used by Linked Data Projects ([LinDa](http://linda-project.eu/)) and similar solutions.

This is a Lab project developed by a team of students of Master in Computer Science at Universit√§t Bonn.
