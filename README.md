Please work in the directory of your team.  Default subdirectories:

* dev – put your implementation (including documentation and tests) here
* presentations – put your presentation material into the respective subdirectories; deadlines for uploading:
  1. original version: just before you present in class
  2. improved version (optional, but may improve your mark): one week after your presentation in class
  
Please always upload a PDF version of your presentation.  In addition to the PDF, you may also maintain the sources of your presentation (PowerPoint, LaTeX, whatever) in this repository. If you do, please do so in a subdirectory src.

If you are planning to present in a different format (e.g. by video, Prezi, etc.), please contact the lab instructors.
